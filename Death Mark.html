                <h2>What is Death Mark?</h2>
                <p>Death Mark is a survival horror visual novel game developed by Experience Inc. and published by Aksys Games. 
                    This game is the company's first horror game, that envelops you with inescapable dread. No matter the location, 
                    there are hidden terrors lurking about. Any sound and shadow could be your chance of survival or your final moments. 
                    The game skillfully combines ordinary and spiritual elements, transforming somber yet relatable misfortunes into supernatural 
                    whodunits that you must unravel before daybreak - otherwise, you die.</p>

                <h2>What's it about?</h2>
                <p>The game's storyline follows in Tokyo’s H City. The protagonist, who the player can name whatever they like or use the default 
                    name of Kazuo Yashiki, has lost his memories and gained a mysterious “mark” on his body. He discovers that he has only a few days 
                    to live, and he must investigate a series of supernatural cases and solve their mysteries to lift the curse before it's too late. 
                    Death Mark’s horror setting sets itself to be an inquisitive adventure game. If you're familiar with the Ace Attorney Series is similar in a regard!</p>

                <h2>My Experience</h2>
                <p> Personally it was enjoyable to go through as I always enjoyed story driven games, these types of games aren't meant for everyone. The most enjoyable being the 
                    game's artwork, sound effects, and music all contribute to creating a creepy and tense atmosphere that keeps the player on edge. The ambiance thrives off of the uneasiness of the characters and the player. 
                    These noises are gusts of wind, creaking ropes, and ghostly singing punctured by sudden laughter and bangs as you explore the world around you. All of this will keep 
                    you on the edge of your seat anticipating the worst at any moment. For this reason I would recommend wearing headphones! It provides an engaging and immersive experience that will keep players hooked until the end. 
                    The game's eerie presentation, challenging puzzles, memorable characters, and multiple endings make it a worthwhile investment for those looking for a unique gaming experience.
