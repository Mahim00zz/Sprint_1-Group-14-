        <h2>How Cricket is Played</h2>
        <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each. The game is played on a circular or oval-shaped field with a 22-yard long pitch at its center. The objective is to score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets. The team that scores the most runs wins the match.</p>
        <p>There are three main formats of cricket: Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20). Each format has its own rules and duration, catering to different audiences and preferences.</p>
