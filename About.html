        <p id="introP">
            As the saying goes, without a concrete plan, it can be hard to be consistent with our hobbies. Life happens and there
            will be plenty of times where we'll find ourselves attached to our laptops trying to debug code. While we do 
            have rough "just got to finish this" days, it's important to set time for ourselves. Not doing so can lead to 
            increased stress. A realistic plan can help us stay consistent with our hobbies. There are many tools you can utilize online and
            offline.

            Our brain thrives with small successes. 
            When we complete an assignment, our brain releases dopamine which makes us feel accomplished. Our brain will recognize this dopamine
            and will feel inspired to experience this activity again for the dopamine hit.
